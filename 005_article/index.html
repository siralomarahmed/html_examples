                <em>Theoretical Computer Science</em> is mathematical and 
                abstract in spirit, but it derives its motivation from the 
                practical and everyday computation. Its aim is to understand the 
                nature of computation and, as a consequence of this 
                understanding, provide more efficient methodologies.

                Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to or is required to 
                synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, 
                decision-making, environmental adaptation, learning, and 
                communication found in humans and animals. From its origins in 
                cybernetics and in the Dartmouth Conference (1956), artificial 
                intelligence research has been necessarily cross-disciplinary, 
                drawing on areas of expertise such as applied mathematics, 
                symbolic logic, semiotics, electrical engineering, philosophy of 
                mind, neurophysiology, and social intelligence. AI is associated 
                in the popular mind with robotic development, but the main field 
                of practical application has been as an embedded component in 
                areas of software development, which require computational 
                understanding.
